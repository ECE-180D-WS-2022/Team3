Testing CameraIface.py with the associated main.py
After running the program with "python main.py" or "python3 main.py", you will be greeted with the Calibration window:

1. Press SPACE to take a picture within the Neon Green Box's boundaries and have it save a file in the same directory: "opencv_frame_0.png"
2. Press ESC to close the calibration window after taking a satisfactory picture of the object to-be-tracked

The program will now run a for loop to print the level and current centroid of the detected object to-be-tracked (No window will show what it is tracking so far)
